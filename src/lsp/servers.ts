/**
 * Which language server serves which filetype.
 *
 * druk knows about no server until an extension names one: the specs live in the
 * market (`extensions/<language>/extension.json` in this repository), so a server for
 * a new language reaches users the moment its pull request merges rather than at
 * the next release. What a spec holds is still only a command looked up on the
 * user's PATH — a missing one means no diagnostics for that language, though
 * druk offers to fetch the ones it can, an npm package or a release binary,
 * into a prefix of its own (see `./install`).
 *
 * The `id` is the key the `lspServers` config setting overrides — a user points
 * it at another command (`{ "typescript": ["deno", "lsp"] }`) or disables the
 * server with an empty array. The settings page toggles servers the same way.
 */

 * How a missing server is obtained. `npm` and `download` are the cases druk can
 * carry out itself — a package install, or a release binary fetched from a URL
 * (see `./install.ts`); `manual` is a line to print, for servers that come with
 * a language toolchain. Servers with neither (clangd, zls, sourcekit-lsp) ship
 * with an SDK, and no one command installs them on every OS.
