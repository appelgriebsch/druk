 * stays legible underneath while clearly reading as inactive. Verified: white text
 * under a 0.45 scrim comes out around #8c8c8c rather than being painted over.
 *
 * Black at partial alpha rather than a theme colour, because it has to recede on a
 * light palette as well as a dark one.
 *
 * Not drawn at all with `transparent` on: blending needs something underneath, and
 * an unpainted cell is nothing — the composite comes out opaque black, so opening
 * any modal painted the whole see-through editor over in black.
