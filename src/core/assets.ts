/**
 * OpenTUI resolves its bundled tree-sitter runtime (`web-tree-sitter/tree-sitter.wasm`),
 * the parser worker and grammar wasm relative to `import.meta.url`. When the core is
 * loaded from Bun's global install cache that lookup misses, so we pin the resolver to
 * the node_modules directory that actually ships those assets via `OTUI_ASSET_ROOT`.
 *
 * The compiled binary has the opposite problem: its native library lives in the
 * embedded filesystem, and dlopen on such a path makes Bun extract it to a *fresh*
 * temp file on every launch. macOS validates the signature of a file it has never
 * seen — measured at ~250ms per start, against ~3ms for a file it has seen — so the
 * library is staged once to a stable per-build cache path and `OTUI_ASSET_ROOT`
 * points OpenTUI's import at it.
 *
 * Everything here is synchronous on purpose. A top-level await would let sibling
 * modules evaluate while it waits — including the `@opentui/core` import whose
 * library resolution this env var exists to steer — so the first launch on a new
 * build takes the slow path and stages in the background for the next one.
 *
 * Imported for its side effect before anything touches the highlighter.
